This package contains a demo of Nanodesktop
OpenCV. The original code owns to Intel, Visilab
has simply modified it to work with PSP.


KSU HOMEBREW

The KSU version (Kernel services to user) of the
homebrew has been designed only for PSP with firmware 
Sony vers. 1.50. 

If you want to use the KSU version of the homebrew, 
use PSPBrew utility to install it on your PSP 
memory stick



HOMEBREW FOR CUSTOM FIRMWARE

The CFW version of the homebrew has been designed
for PSP FAT or SLIM with custom firmware vers.
3.71 M33-4. 

If you want to use the CFW version of the homebrew,
you have to copy the PBP file in your memory stick
(don't use PSPBREW !). 




DRIVERS

The KSU and the CFW versions of Nanodesktop 
applications, need a special driver to work.

Copy in the root folder of your memory stick:

a) the driver ndUsbDriver.Prx for the "KSU version" 
homebrews 

b) the driver ndUsbDriverCF.Prx and the extender module
ndKrnExtender.Prx for the "CFW version" of the 
homebrew. 

All drivers are freely redistributable and they are
all included in this zip package. 



WEBCAM SUPPORT

Remember that KSU homebrews support only Eyeserver 
connection for camera; the CFW versions, instead,
support natively either Sony GoCam or Eyeserver
connection.
